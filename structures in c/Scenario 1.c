to be stored is: Account number, Name, Balance in account.
Assume maximum of 200 customers in the bank.

each customer with balance below Rs. 100.
(2) If a customer requests for withdrawal or deposit, the form
contains the fields:

Write a program to give a message, “The balance is insufficient
for the specified withdrawal”, if on withdrawal the balance falls
below Rs. 100.
